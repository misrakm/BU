    "<b>Ans:</b>\n",
    "I have gone thought the Pie Chart of Survey Results on page 1 of the Figure 0.1 As per the label on the picture this is an example of an ineffective graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Pros: </i>\n",
    "1. This is a small pie chart with only 5 Legend, which is ok to understand the segments\n",
    "2. Multiple colors of the pie chart segments help to segregate different outcome of the survey result.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Cons:</i>\n",
    "1. This chart does not give any details about the survey or the segments of that chart. (I can get more information once we go through the later half of the introduction)\n",
    "2. The Color combination is not meaningful and light and dark shades of blue color is used to two opposite segments.\n",
    "3. Making a Bar chart horizontal or vertical will be very helpful to compare various segments a there is more than 2-3 segments present in the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Choice of Pie-Chart</i>: <br>\n",
    "I don't think it is excellent choice as described earlier. If there were 2-3 segments in the chart may be Pie chart would have been better but Horizontal or vertical bar chart would have best as there are 5 or more segments in the chart and it will be easy to compare them internally or with any other reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>The color scheme:</i> <br>\n",
    "As described earlier in the cons it is not a good choice of colors as both 'Bored' and  'Excited' is having different shades of blue even though they are almost opposite. Also nearby segments like 'Not great' and 'OK' are having opposite colors like red and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>The legend:</i> <br>\n",
    "It is good that is showing all the relevant legend but you have to remember the legend color with the relevant pie in the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>The title:</i> <br>\n",
    "There title neither shows details about the data it is collected nor what does it represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>How would I draw if differently:</i> <br>\n",
    "Sorry to say but my idea matches with the author of the book. I don't know the reason if it is because I have seen the other graph or simply because it is better. As told earlier I like to make is vertical bar chart which will be really good to compare and understand the data also we can spell out, what story the graph is telling.<br>\n",

I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph.  However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that.  You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."
